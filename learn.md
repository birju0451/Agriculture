# 🌾 AgriTech: Smart Farming Redefined

**Welcome to AgriTech!**  
An AI‑powered web platform designed to empower farmers with data-driven tools for smarter, more sustainable agriculture.

---

## 🚜 What It Does

1. **Crop Recommendation**  
   Suggests the best crops to grow based on soil nutrients (N, P, K), weather (temperature, humidity, rainfall), and pH.

2. **Yield Prediction**  
   Forecasts potential crop yields to help with planning and resource allocation.

3. **Disease Detection**  
   Scans crop images to identify diseases early using computer vision.

4. **Farmer Collaboration**  
   Lets farmers connect, share insights, and discuss best practices.

## 🧩 Why It Matters

AgriTech bridges the gap between traditional farming and modern insights. With tools like AI-driven recommendations, yield forecasts, and disease protection, farmers can:

- Maximize their harvest with precision choices  
- Act quickly against crop diseases  
- Work smarter and sustainably  
- Build a community of shared wisdom

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Python, Flask  
- **Machine Learning**: scikit-learn, NumPy, Pandas  
- **CV**: OpenCV (for disease detection)  
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Jinja2  
- **Environment**: Virtualenv, requirements.txt for reproducibility
